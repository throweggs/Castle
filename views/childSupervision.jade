				.text-left <strong>Guidelines:</strong>
      
			ul.text-left
				li <b> Each adult climber can only supervise one non-climbing child at a time.</b>	This is to ensure that children are adequately supervised in a dangerous environment. 
				li Each child should have <b>one designated responsible adult</b>	who completes the form below and is responsible for ensuring the proper supervision of that child at all times. 
				li <b>You are responsible for the safety of the child under your supervision.</b>
				li Proper supervision means that the child is with you or another responsible adult at all times and that you are always aware of their actions and able to prevent them from coming to harm or endangering other users. 
				li Non-climbing children may not climb anywhere within the centre or in the garden. 
				li Children must not be in a climbing or bouldering landing zone and they must not distract belayers. 
				li Please ensure that buggies, toys, etc. do not pose an additional hazard for other users.
				li Children are not permitted in The Gym. 
      
		.text-left.p If you are unable to supervise the child to the standards expected, you will be asked to leave the centre.
